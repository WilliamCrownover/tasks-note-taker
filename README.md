## Description

This web application was built as a helpful tool for keeping track of tasks as saved notes hosted on Heroku. The app uses Express.js for the back end server functions pulling JSON data from a database file. By deploying the code to Heroku, the database is persistent across multiple machines through a server so that the user can come back to the app later without losing valuable task notes. The appâ€™s functionality includes a delete process so that the user can clear out finished tasks easily. I gained valuable experience in routing page display and api paths through a master index.js file which will allow for expanded functionality in the future.
